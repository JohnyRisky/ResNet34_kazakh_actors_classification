Used ResNet34 model and its last layer .fc to teach the model classifi actors including our Kazakhstani actors Askar Ilyasov and Daniyar Alshinov

For dataset downloading and structure setting use actors_images_crawler.ipynb file
It is necessary to manually filter crawled images as after that use actors_images_augmentation.ipynb file to augment downloaded images as it takes too much time to more than 100 images especially Kazakhstani actors

The model works and classifies actors but not very well yet. Still working on the improvement of реу model;s prediction skills.
